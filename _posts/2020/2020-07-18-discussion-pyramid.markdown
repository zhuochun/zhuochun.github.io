A quick snapshot of my mental model on discussing product features.

## How to read it?

### Level 1: What is the problem to be solved? For who? Why is it important?

This answers the [job to be done](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca).

### Level 2: Where the problem fits in?

This answers the perspectives on reasoning above the problem.

### Level 3: What are the possible solutions?

This answers the new workflows to solve the problem in the domain.

### Level 4: How to execute the solution?

This answers the implementation details, dependencies-and constraints.

## How to use it?

These are a few rules to follow:

### The levels above define the levels below

Failed to communicate or align on the top levels results in bad executions at the lower levels.

Common conflicts:

- Shaky work. E.g. when top levels are based on one-sided assumptions or the requirement is competition driven.
- Lost the big pictures. E.g. getting questioned about the intent of the feature. solution is short-sighted or execution is not extensivable.
- Bloated requirements. E.g. "We can do these together!" when the solution can lump multiple problems.

### The levels below constitute the levels above

The constraints below limit *one level* above.

Common conflicts:

- "It is a hack!" E.g. when the problem is addressed in a wrong domain; the solution is pushed through and discarded concerns from execution.

### Discuss on a level higher than your problem level

As Albert Einstein said, "we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them".

Common conflicts:

- Cannot achieve alighnment. E.g. debating on low levels challenges when the alignment issue is happening at the higher level.
