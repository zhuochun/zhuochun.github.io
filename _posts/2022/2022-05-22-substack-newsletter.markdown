I started a writing project on [substack](https://bicrement.substack.com/).

This is how I started ([original post](https://bicrement.substack.com/p/start-my-writing-project?s=w)):

```
This project has been on my mind for a while now. Yet, getting started is always the biggest obstacle.

Last Tuesday night, I thought it would be easier to start by setting an effortless bar.

So, I came up with three rules:

- I will do it biweekly because weekly feels scary.
- I will write the draft over audio first. It stops me from editing. And I hope it will help me get better at pacing my speech and thinking.
- Lastly, I will keep it short. Just one opinion or one story is enough.

And, to make sure I won't run out of topics quickly, I had a quick walkthrough of my notes. They should last for a while.

There is one thing I haven't decided, should I start quietly or loudly?

Well. I will let my impulse decide at the right time.
```
