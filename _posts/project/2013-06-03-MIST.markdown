Mobile Interactive Supervised Therapy (MIST) is the final year project (2013/2014) of my bachelor degree (Computer Engineering) in National University of Singapore.

This project is mentored by [Prof Wei Tsang Ooi](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/), under School of Computing, and in collaboration with National University Hospital.
